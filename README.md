
🤖 Chatbot using NLP and Streamlit

An interactive Chatbot built with Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Streamlit, using machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression for intent classification. The bot provides meaningful responses and maintains conversation logs for further analysis.

🌟 Features
Intent Recognition: Classifies user inputs into predefined intents using NLP techniques.
Interactive Web UI: Built with Streamlit for easy accessibility and usability.
Conversation Logging: Logs user inputs and bot responses into chat_log.csv for analysis.
Scalable: Easily extendable for more intents, deep learning models, or multilingual support.
🧠 Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Natural Language Toolkit (nltk): Tokenization and preprocessing of text data.
Scikit-learn: Logistic Regression for classification.
Streamlit: Framework for building the chatbot's web interface.
TfidfVectorizer: Converts text data into numerical representations.
🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8 or higher
Install the required Python libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install streamlit sklearn nltk
Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Chatbot-NLP.git
cd Chatbot-NLP
Ensure your intents.json file (containing training data) is in the root directory.

Run the application:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Open the URL provided by Streamlit to access the chatbot in your browser.

📊 Dataset Details
The chatbot uses a JSON file (intents.json) structured as:

Tag: The intent of the user query (e.g., "greeting", "goodbye").
Patterns: Example user queries for the intent.
Responses: The chatbot's possible replies.
Example JSON Snippet:
json
Copy code
[
    {
        "tag": "greeting",
        "patterns": ["Hi", "Hello", "Hey"],
        "responses": ["Hello! How can I assist you?", "Hi there!"]
    }
]
🛠️ Future Enhancements
Integrate Deep Learning models like LSTM or Transformers for better accuracy.
Add multilingual support for broader accessibility.
Deploy on cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, etc.) for production readiness.
Visualize chatbot interactions using data analytics dashboards.
